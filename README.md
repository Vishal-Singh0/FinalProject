Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
Mongoose
JWT (for authentication)
Machine Learning:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model
Used for course recommendations and learning path optimization.
Data Engineering Pipeline:
Four-layer architecture: Raw Layer, Clean Layer, and Reporting Layer.
System Architecture
Frontend Application:
The React-based frontend provides an intuitive interface for both admins and employees.
Key features include employee progress tracking, course management, quiz completion, certificate access, and interactive learning path visualizations.
Backend Services:
